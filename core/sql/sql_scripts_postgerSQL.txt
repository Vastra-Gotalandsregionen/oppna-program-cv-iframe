===============================================================================

If the table already exists in an older version and contains data, we need
to handle this manually (column has been added and constraints altered):

1. Create the new table as vgr_user_site_credential_new instead

2. Create below function copy_user_site_credentials

3. Run function [select copy_user_site_credentials()]

4. Verify that all data has been copied into the new table

5. Stop server

6. Rename vgr_user_site_credential to vgr_user_site_credential_old and vgr_user_site_credential_new to vgr_user_site_credential

7. Deploy portlet

8. Start server 

9. Drop table vgr_user_site_credential_old and function copy_user_site_credentials if everything is ok
