= Introduction =

The Site-key is a placeholder for which credential are used to authenticate the user on login for a particular site.

Different sites sometimes use the same authentication mechanism (a limited SSO domain). Then the site-key is reusable and and CS-IFrame allows the user to only supply the credential once, thus taking advantage of as much of the authentication infrastructure as possible.

==List view==
Site-key administration are reached on the settings page of the CS-Admin portlet.

All Site-keys in the portal are displayed in a list.

The key is the value used to reference the site-key in code. It also has a title and a description. 
New Site-key's are created by clicking on the button under the list, every Site-key can be edited and deleted.

When deleting a Site-key all user credentials associated with this key will be deleted. 

_*- Be careful: Stored user credentials are valuable -*_. Every time the user has to reenter his credentials without having initiated the change himself, will erode the trust of the portal site. 

It is often better to inactivate a Site-key first, and later when it is absolutely clear that the credentials never will be needed again, remove it.

==Edit view==

All values in the Site-key can be changed.

However, be very careful when changing the key. It is used in the user credential tabel and big update will be run, and even if everything is done transactional, care is advised.

When doing external integrations it is the key that are referenced, this is another reason to be very restrictive in changing the key.

It is possible to use HTML in the description field, so it is possible to provide both images and links in the site description.

One way to use the description field is to provide instructions and contact information of how to acquire access to the site. If the description is complicated and need a lot of instruction, provide a link to the instructions instead.

A Site-key has to be activated to be selectable in the CS-IFrame configuration. 

This is how it can look inside CS-IFrame configuration:
