= Introduction =

The Site-key is a placeholder for which credential are used to authenticate the user on login for a particular site.

Different sites sometimes use the same authentication mechanism (a limited SSO domain). Then the site-key is reusable and and CS-IFrame allows the user to only supply the credential once, thus taking advantage of as much of the authentication infrastructure as possible.
