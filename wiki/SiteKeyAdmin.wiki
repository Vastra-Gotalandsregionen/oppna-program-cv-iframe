= Introduction =

The Site-key is a placeholder for which credential are used to authenticate the user on login for a particular site.

Different sites sometimes use the same authentication mechanism (a limited SSO domain). Then the site-key is reusable and and CS-IFrame allows the user to only supply the credential once, thus taking advantage of as much of the authentication infrastructure as possible.

The key is the value used to reference the site-key in code. It also has a title and a description. 
New Site-key's are created by clicking on the button under the list, every Site-key can be edited and deleted.

When deleting a Site-key all user credentials associated with this key will be deleted. 

_*- Be careful: Stored user credentials are valuable -*_. Every time the user has to enter his credentials without having initiated the change himself will erode the trust of the site. 

It is often better to inactivate a Site-key first, and later when it is absolutely clear that the credentials never will be needed again, remove it.

==Edit view==




A Site-key has to be activated to be selectable in an CS-IFrame.
