= Introduction =

The PasswordMigration module is a standalone Java application which is run from a command-line terminal. The module was created in order to migrate all stored passwords (i.e. all UserSiteCredentials) from one encryption cipher to another.

The current implementation can migrate between AES with ECB block mode and AES with CTR block mode, in both directions. For more information on cryptographic block modes, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation.

When migrating between AES/ECB and AES/CTR the same key is used for the new cipher texts as the old cipher texts (cipher text = encrypted password).

An additional feature is that the cipher texts can be updated so that they can only be decrypted with a newly created key. This may be useful e.g. if there is a risk that the current key has leaked. Even if the key does not leak it is still recommended to update the key regularly.

Note that backup of the database is highly recommended prior to using the PasswordMigration module.

= Details =

It is convenient to run the module from the local computer where the local development environment is located.

First build the project:
oppna-program-cv-iframe/core/modules/application/mvn clean install

Cd to the target directory:
cd target
