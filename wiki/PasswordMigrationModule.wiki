= Introduction =

The migration module (just called "the module" hereafter) enables the migration of currently stored cipher texts (encrypted passwords) to be based on a new cipher. For a general introduction to ciphers, please go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher. The module can also migrate the cipher texts calculated by one key to be recalculated using a new key.

The purpose of the module is to retain or increase security even if threats are encountered. Security and cryptography is a dynamic field and what is considered safe today may not be considered safe in the future.

= Details =

To migrate a set of cipher texts an implementation of `CryptoUtil` are chosen to decrypt the current cipher texts and another implementation is chosen to encrypt the passwords to new cipher texts.
